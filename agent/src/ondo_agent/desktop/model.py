"""The platform-neutral view of a desktop: windows and named elements.

Rung two of the ladder. Every backend (AT-SPI on Linux, UI Automation on
Windows, AXUIElement on macOS) reduces its OS tree to these types, and the tools
only ever see these types.

Elements are addressed by *locator* — window, role, name and which occurrence of
that role and name — never by coordinates or by an OS handle. A locator is
resolved against a fresh read of the tree every time it is used. That is what
survives a moved window, a rescaled display, and the stale references macOS 26
is known for: there is nothing cached to go stale.
