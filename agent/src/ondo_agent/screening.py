"""Untrusted-content screening, on every file read and every page snapshot.

One boolean question: does this text contain instructions directed at an agent?
It has to be cheap enough to run on everything, because partial screening is
close to no screening.

Screening does not decide anything on its own. A flagged read is still returned
to the model, fenced as data, with a notice naming what was found, and the run is
marked *tainted*: from then on every action with an effect beyond reading goes
to a person, whatever the gate model thinks. Effect gates stay independent of the
model's judgment either way.
